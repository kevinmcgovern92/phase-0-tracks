# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a mechanism by which one tracks modifications to a file or group of files. It allows one to return to a given iteration of code and walk back any disastrous changes - and many more mundane uses.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of a repository that one would make to actively work on code. One uses branches in order to maintain the hygiene of the master code.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a formal submission of changed file. A good commit message is succinct and outlines exactly what the new code's purpose is.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when two branches are unable to merge successfully. One example would be having different code on the same line in two branches -- git can't tell which code is supposed to take precedence, so there is a conflict that would have to be resolved manually.
