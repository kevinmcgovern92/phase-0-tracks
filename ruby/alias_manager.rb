#Pseudocode for alias method
# Prompt user for real name
  # Assume input to be one string of two words
  # Downcase
# Swap the first and last letters of the name
  # Potentially by assigning to a new array?
# Change all vowels to the next vowel
  # Use a string of "aeiou" in the same way that we used the alphabet string for the decrypter
