Algorithm for robot to use elevator.
- Each time human needs to move floors:
  - Approach elevator bay and ask human "Going  up or down?"
    - If the response is "up":
      - Press the higher of two buttons on the  panel
    - If the response is "down":
      - Press the lower of the two buttons on   the panel
  - When elevator door opens, move inside and ask "What floor?"
    - If the response is "lobby":
      - Press the button marked with "L" or emblazoned with a star
      - Follow human after it leaves elevator
    - If the response is "basement":
      - Press the button marked with a "B"
      - Follow human after it leaves elevator
    - If the resopnse is "mezzanine":
      - "Press the button marked with "N"
      - Follow human after it leaves elevator
    - If the response is "roof":
      - Press the button marked "R"
      - Follow human after it leaves elevator
      - If "R" is not an option:
        - Press the button with the highest numerical value
        - Follow human after it leaves elevator
    - If the response is a numerical value:
      - Locate the button corresponding to the numerical value
      - Press appropriate button
      - Follow human after it leaves elevator
    - Otherwise:
      - Say "Does not compute"
      - Power down

Algorithm for making coffe
- Examine coffee tin
  - Until coffe tin is half-full:
   - If coffee tin is empty:
     - Go to coffee bag
       - If bag is not empty:
         - Pour whole beans into grinder
         - Grind until coarse
         - Pour grounds into coffee tin
       - If bag is empty:
        - Go to store
        - Buy a pound of coffee beans and a coffee
    - If coffee tin is not empty but less than half full:
      - Go to coffee bag
       - If bag is not empty:
         - Pour whole beans into grinder
         - Grind until coarse
         - Pour grounds into coffee tin
      - If bag is empty:
        - Go to store
        - Buy a pound of coffee beans and a coffee
  - While  coffee tin is at least half-full:
    - Fill coffee pitcher with 6 cups of water
    - Pour water into coffee maker reservoir
    - Measure out 2 Tbsp of ground coffee
    - Pour coffee into filter
    - Move water spout above filter
    - Close top and turn on the coffee machine
    - Wait until coffee has finished brewing
    - Pour into mug
    - Enjoy!
  - When coffee pitcher is empty:
    - Turn machine off
    - Throw out filter and grounds
    - Place new filter in machine
