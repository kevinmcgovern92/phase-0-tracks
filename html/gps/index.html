    <p>The purpose of HTML5 tags is to provide more intuitive semantic structure for the content inside of html documents. To that end, I think that nav and main are two of the most important. It's imperative for users to be able to navigate through web pages in an easy way, and the nav element allows developers a framework to do so.The main tag lets developers designate what the most important content in the body is. Just as there is a hierarchy for h tags, main sits at the top of that order for what the dev really wants to convey on a given page.</p>
    <p>I'm not sure I understand this question. The browser will interpret html in the order it's written, but CSS can be used to change where exactly on the page elements appear.</p>
    <p>Snippets and even more about autocomplete. I will definitely be using snippets in the future -- including the snippet we created during this exercise.</p>
    <p>Figuring out exactly what the correct use of the various html5 tags are was pretty difficult. The flowchart provided to us was helpful, but I think I'll need to just dive into either the official documentation, or look for cheatsheets specific to html5.</p>
