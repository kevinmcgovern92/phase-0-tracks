## Praxis of learning jQuery

#### Always subject to change, but general guidelines to be followed

  - Start with codecademy and other tutorials
    - If there is a specific question, consult stack overflow or similar resource. Personal experience shows they will not cover my question :)

  - Use cheatsheets to shore up general knowledge and become more comfortable with syntax

  - Take a break every 45 minutes (unless on a roll)

  - Keep an open mind (don't be too attached to any one idea while learning something new)

  - Don't stress out!
